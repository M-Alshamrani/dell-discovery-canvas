## 2 · In flight — rc.7 / 7e-8 v2 deletion arc

**Goal**: delete v2 architecture entirely; v3 engagement is the sole source of truth.

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A · Test-scope expansion | V-ANTI-V2-IMPORT-1/2/3 scan ALL production files via manifest | ✅ done |
| B · sessionFile v3-native | + new `state/runtimeMigrate.js` canonical home | ✅ done |
| C · gapsService v3-native | reads via `getActiveEngagement().gaps` | ✅ done |
| D · vendorMixService v3-native | reads via `getActiveEngagement().instances` | ✅ done |
| E · DELETE `ui/views/AiAssistOverlay.js` | dormant since rc.4 · Cmd+K → openCanvasChat | ✅ done |
| F · DELETE `ui/views/SkillAdmin.js` | 608 LOC · superseded by SkillBuilder | ✅ done |
| G · DELETE `state/sessionBridge.js` | 398 LOC · listener flipped to `subscribeActiveEngagement` | ✅ done |
| **H + J + K · Path (c) mega-commit** | Inline 4 v2-shape factories into shim · DELETE 5 modules (sessionStore + 3 interaction modules + sessionEvents) · 929 LOC removed | ✅ **done** |

**What just shipped (Path (c) mega-commit)**:
- 4 v2-shape data factories (`session`, `createEmptySession`, `addInstance`, `createGap`) inlined into `diagnostics/_v2TestFixtures.js` — Phase I-B-31..34 v2-literal pattern extended to the shim's last 4 members.
- DELETED `state/sessionStore.js` (220 LOC), `interactions/matrixCommands.js` (143), `interactions/gapsCommands.js` (263), `interactions/desiredStateSync.js` (237), `core/sessionEvents.js` (66) = **929 LOC removed**.
- `app.js`, `interactions/aiCommands.js`, `state/aiUndoStack.js`: 5 `emitSessionChanged()` calls replaced with direct `markSaving()` (the only side-effect that didn't ride the engagementStore subscriber chain) — legacy bus retired.
- `appSpec.js` V-FLOW-CHAT-DEMO-1 retired vector-id-preserving (its v2-emit-doesn't-clobber-v3 contract is satisfied by the v2 emit no longer existing).
- `demoSpec.js` DS16/DS17 rewritten to assert `subscribeActiveEngagement` listeners fire (R6: rewrite to v3 contract, never retire-with-negative).
- **V-FLOW-V3-PURE-1/3/4/5 all flipped GREEN** (4 RED → 0 RED).

**Estimate to rc.7 tag**: 7e-post (FS3 + BUG-042 + VT29 viewport investigation) → tag (PREFLIGHT 5b real-LLM smoke gated to user).

| BUG-040 | Medium | Workload can map to retired asset (relationship invariant gap) | rc.8 / GA hardening |
| BUG-046 | Medium | AI chat enhancement — instance NAMES (selectInstancesByVendor), calculation-methodology transparency, anticipatory user-confusion handling, perf (OpenAI caching) | v3.1 polish arc |
| BUG-050 | Medium | Workload "↑ Propagate criticality" button appears disabled after first cycle + add-asset (NEEDS-REPRO — could not reproduce in live test, queued for user-side detail) | rc.7 / 7e-post (if reproduces) or v3.1 |

**Closed since rc.6 tag**:
- `709e778` BUG-041 (AI Assist provider popover stale snapshot)

- `af2c26a` BUG-043 (welcome-card "Load demo session" doesn't render demo)
- `1c306dc` + `1deda90` BUG-044 (UUIDs leak into gap tiles + AI chat — both halves)
- `2026-05-09` BUG-019 (engagement auto-rehydrate per SPEC §S31; verified live)
- `2026-05-09` BUG-027 (broad test-pass cloak rule covers all body-level rogue probes)
- `2026-05-09` BUG-028 (side-panel stacking per SPEC §S36.1; chat persists when Skills opens)
- `2026-05-09` BUG-001 + BUG-002 (v2 root path deleted in Step J; v3 propagate-criticality flow correctly reads `applied[0].newCrit` for toast + creates fresh button on each panel re-mount)
- `2026-05-09` BUG-045 (SettingsModal "Couldn't save" — initial-open path missed `_settings` because Save lookup scoped to `.overlay-body` wrap instead of `.settings-body` inner)

- `2026-05-09` BUG-048 (right-pane detail panel disappears on Save — selection lifted to module scope + restored on re-mount)
- `2026-05-09` BUG-049 (UUIDs leak in Reporting Initiative pipeline — env UUID→envCatalogId remap added to v3Projection.getEngagementAsSession)
- `2026-05-09` BUG-051 + BUG-032 (closes the "linked state button deactivated" workshop bug — root cause was selectedGapId closure-locality in GapsEditView; fixed by lifting to module scope per the BUG-048 pattern)

## 4 · Backlog beyond rc.7

### rc.8 / GA hardening
- **R8 invariant arc** (6 deferred items from rc.7 / 7e-8 — see HANDOFF "Open R8 backlog" table):
  - #1 v3 `updateGap` — AL10 / `validateActionLinks` enforcement on reviewed-flip
  - #2 v3 `mapWorkloadAssets` — self-map / workload→workload / cross-state / dedupe invariants

  - #4 v3 `_gapLinkInstance` — PHASE_CONFLICT_NEEDS_ACK on phase-mismatched link
  - #5 v3 setPrimaryLayer-rebalance + auto-flip-reviewed contracts (T6.6 / PR5 / RH7-19 retired)
  - #6 manual-add-dialog reviewed:true UI-contract test (T6.5 retired)

- BUG-021 AI performance (OpenAI prompt caching wiring)
- Real-LLM live-key smoke at PREFLIGHT 5b · GA gate
- Real-customer `.canvas` migration smoke · GA gate
- Pre-GA hardening + workshop validation round 2
- Merge `v3.0-data-architecture` → `main`

### v3.1 crown-jewel UI polish
- BUG-022 modern chat shell
- BUG-037 user / assistant message differentiation
- BUG-038 Skill Builder UX redesign
- GPLC-aligned visual polish (per `project_crown_jewel_design.md`)
- Whitespace · drawer IA · icons · tag vocab · color discipline (5 ranked factors)
- v2.5.0 / v2.5.1 split per `project_crown_jewel_design.md`

### v3.1+ data-model widening
- BUG-039 vendor mix deployment-scale field (`instance.deployedQuantity` schema change → migrator + V-MIG vectors)
- Possible: relationship-strength typing for gap.related* edges
- Possible: cross-environment workload mapping with explicit affectedEnvironments

### v3.1+ session lifecycle management — **NEW BACKLOG (2026-05-09 PM)**

Per user direction 2026-05-09 evening: presales workshops accumulate substantial state during a session (drivers + envs + instances + gaps + AI mutations). Today the in-memory engagement persists to localStorage on every commit (SPEC §S31), but there's no rolling-history surface for time-travel within a session and no explicit-save/delete management. Workshop-friendly RPO + undo controls needed.

**Scope sketch** (subject to SPEC §S44 + RULES authoring before implementation):

- **Rolling auto-saves with RPO** — every ~3 minutes, snapshot the active engagement to a session-history slot. Cap N (e.g. 20 slots = ~1 hour of rolling history). User can rewind to any slot. Persistence: localStorage (multiple keys) or IndexedDB (cleaner for the snapshot fan-out).
- **Manual save points** — explicit "save snapshot now" button surfaces in the topbar; user-named slot + timestamp; included in the rolling-history view.
- **Saves browser** — UI surface (modal or panel) listing all snapshots with timestamps + previews (driver count, env count, gap count, customer name); click to restore. Confirmation prompt before restore (overwrites in-memory state).
- **Per-snapshot delete + delete-undo** — user can delete a snapshot from the list; undo within session window (pushes onto the existing AI-undo-style stack OR a separate session-undo stack with same shape).
- **AI-mutation undo extension** — extend the existing `state/aiUndoStack.js` shape (already AI-write-aware) to cover ALL state mutations, not just AI proposal applies. Or keep the AI-undo-stack scoped to AI writes + introduce a sibling `state/manualUndoStack.js` for manual edits + delete-undo. Architecturally cleaner separation.
- **Cross-session save/restore** — separate from in-session snapshots. The existing `Save to file` / `Open file` `.canvas` workbook flow handles this today. Session-snapshot system is the in-session RPO layer.

**Architectural prerequisites**:
- SPEC §S44 (NEW) authoring — entity model for snapshot (id, timestamp, label, isManual, engagementSnapshot ref, parentSnapshotId for delta-storage if scope warrants)
- TESTS V-FLOW-SNAPSHOT-* contract (auto-save fires every 3min while engagement-dirty, manual save on demand, restore round-trips JSON-identical, delete-undo within window, AI-undo + manual-undo stacks coexist)
- RULES §16 CH37 (NEW) — snapshot lifecycle invariants (no-snapshot-during-replay; snapshot count cap; corruption tolerance like `_rehydrateFromStorage`)
- Storage decision — localStorage multiple keys (simple but quota-bound) vs IndexedDB (no quota concerns, async API). Probably IndexedDB given the snapshot fan-out.

**Out of scope** (related but separate):
- Multi-engagement session switching (already partially modeled per HANDOFF)
- Cloud-side cross-device snapshot sync (would require Dell-side identity service)

**Status**: BACKLOGGED — NOT scheduled. Authoring sequence locked: SPEC + RULES + TESTS authored before code per `feedback_spec_and_test_first.md`.

### v3.x naming pass (after v2 fully retired)
- Drop `v3` prefix from module / symbol / UI names per `feedback_no_version_prefix_in_names.md`
- Mechanical rename only — no behaviour change

## 5 · Locked discipline (binding for every commit)

These are the non-negotiable rules every session and every commit must follow. Full text in [docs/PRINCIPAL_ARCHITECT_DISCIPLINE.md](docs/PRINCIPAL_ARCHITECT_DISCIPLINE.md).

- **R0** acknowledge "what would a principal architect do?" before non-trivial action
- **R1** own-grep before delete (no closed-list scope)
- **R2** migrate consumers FIRST · delete LAST
- **R3** Chrome MCP browser smoke at every commit boundary
- **R4** no v3-store backward-compat hacks
- **R5** no fig-leaf test fixtures hiding v2 logic
- **R6** rewrite tests to assert v3 contracts (never retire-with-negative)
- **R7** per-commit revertibility (REVERT, don't fix forward when smoke fails)
- **R8** surface scope balloons (don't ship "fix forward" without user direction)
- **R9** every handover references this discipline
- **R10** acknowledge in every action out loud
- **R11** Recite + Answer + Execute + Pledge-Smoke-Screenshot at every step boundary · `Browser smoke evidence:` block in every commit message · test banner alone is a discipline violation

Companion locks (memory anchors auto-loaded each session):
- `feedback_no_mocks.md` — no mock providers, no scripted-LLM fixtures, real-LLM smoke is validation
- `feedback_spec_and_test_first.md` — SPEC + RULES + V-* tests authored BEFORE implementation
- `feedback_test_or_it_didnt_ship.md` — every BUG-NNN fix MUST add a regression test
- `feedback_no_patches_flag_first.md` — patches that bypass schema/validation/architecture are forbidden; surface alternatives first
- `feedback_browser_smoke_required.md` — every tag MUST include Chrome MCP smoke + real-LLM smoke at PREFLIGHT 5b
- `feedback_no_push_without_approval.md` — never `git push` without explicit user instruction
- `feedback_dockerfile_whitelist.md` — every new top-level dir → Dockerfile COPY in the same commit

## 6 · How a fresh session picks this up

1. Read this `ROADMAP.md` first for the big picture.
2. Read [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for operational detail (current HEAD, last commits, the active strategic fork).
3. Read [memory/feedback_principal_architect_discipline.md](memory/feedback_principal_architect_discipline.md) — tier-1 anchor; loads first via MEMORY.md.
4. Run `docker compose up -d --build` and verify banner matches §0 above.
5. Pick up where HANDOFF's "Brief prompt to continue" leaves off — DO NOT pick the (a)/(b) strategic fork unilaterally; wait for user direction.

## 7 · Update protocol for this document

This file is the single canonical roadmap. Update it when:
- A new release ships (move row from §2 In flight to §1 Released)
- A bug is closed (remove row from §3, add to release notes)
- A new bug is reported (add row to §3 with severity + scheduled bucket)
- A scope decision changes (update §2 estimates or §4 backlog)
- The R8 backlog table in HANDOFF.md grows (mirror to §4 rc.8)

Detail belongs in source-of-truth docs (HANDOFF for operational, BUG_LOG for bug detail, RELEASE_NOTES for shipped detail). This roadmap stays under ~250 lines so it's actually scannable.
